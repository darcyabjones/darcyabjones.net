<h1>Bioplotlib</h1>

<p>
Bioplotlib is a library extending the capabilities of the python plotting library matplotlib to support plotting of biological data.
It is a project started out of frustration with the current tools to visualise biological data.
Many plotting libraries do some things well, but often over-simplify the process making it difficult to extend its capabilities.

<p>
Bioplotlib provides shapes and convenient methods to plot: genomic features, alignments, cladograms and phylogenies, ideograms, and linkage maps.
It is designed to drop in seamlessly with matplotlib so that you still have access to native plotting geometries (eg. histograms and scatterplots).
Furthermore, being written in python means that you get access to all of the computational goodies that scipy, numpy, pandas, and biopython packages have to offer.
