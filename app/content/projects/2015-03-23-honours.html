<p>
    In plant-pathogen systems, pathogen-host specificity is often governed by
    the gene-for-gene model, where a plant resistance (<em>R</em>) gene confers
    resistance to infection by pathogens possessing a corresponding avirulence
    gene (<em>Avr</em>). Effectors are pathogenic molecules that modify hosts
    and facilitate pathogen infection. I will be dissecting the co-evolution of
    the fungal pathogen <em>Venturia inaequalis</em> and <em>Malus spp</em>.
    We are looking for the molecular determinants conferring virulence (avr) or
    avirulence (Avr) of <em>V. inaequalis</em> Races 1 and 5, on <em>Malus</em>
    hosts possessing the <em>Rvi5</em> (formerly <em>Vm</em>) resistance gene
    (i.e. <em>M. micromalus</em>).
