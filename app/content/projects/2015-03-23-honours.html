<p>
    In plant-pathogen systems, pathogen-host specificity is often described by the
    the gene-for-gene model, where a plant resistance (<em>R</em>) gene confers
    resistance to infection by pathogens possessing a corresponding avirulence
    gene (<em>Avr</em>). Effectors are pathogenic molecules that modify some aspect of the host to facilitate pathogen infection.
    However, effectors are also the elicitors of resistance responses (i.e. they are the products of <em>Avr</em> genes) meaning that the presence or absence an effector determines the virulence of an isolate against hosts with different <em>R</em>-genes.

    <em>Venturia inaequalis</em>, the causal agent of apple scab, is the most significant pathogen of <em>Malus spp.</em> worldwide.
    Many <em>R</em>-gene loci have already been characterised in <em>Malus</em> species, and in order select the most durable options for deployment, further characterisation of both the resistant plants, and the physiological races of <em>V. inaequalis</em> that overcome them, is required.
    <em>Rvi5</em> from the crab-apple, <em>M. micromalus</em>, is one such potentially durable resistance gene.

    My project chracterised 10 candidate effector genes for <em>AvrRvi5</em> (identified by Jason Shiller) using bio-informatics and wet lab techniques.
    Gene models and predicted variations were validated using existing <em>de novo</em> genome assemblies and RNASeq data.
    One <em>AvrRvi5</em> candidate was eliminated as a result of these analyses.
    A cluster of syntenic scaffolds between the genome sequences of three unrelated <em>V. inaequalis</em> isolates was found to contain eight of the 10 <em>AvrRvi5</em> candidate genes.
    Evidence of major chromosomal rearrangements due to transposable element invasion was found in this genomic region.
    The <em>in vitro</em> growth rates of 10 <em>V. inaequalis</em> isolates were measured and the growth rate was found not to be correlated with physiological races 1 or 5.
    Thus no fitness cost for race 5 (loss of <em>AvrRvi5</em>) was evident from this analysis.
    To facilitate future analyses, six putative <em>Rvi5</em> plants were genotyped; however, further phenotyping is required to validate these potentially resistant plants.
